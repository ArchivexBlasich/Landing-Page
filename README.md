# Landing Page Project

This is a simple landing page built as part of a Flexbox practice exercise. The goal of this project was to gain experience structuring and styling a basic webpage layout using only HTML and CSS (with Flexbox).

## Project Overview

The page includes:

- A **hero section** with main headline text.
- Three additional content sections.
- A **footer**.

The layout and styling were based on provided design mockups (Image One: Full Design, Image Two: Colors and Fonts).

## Development Approach

- HTML was written first for each section to get the content in place.
- CSS styling was applied after content structure was complete.
- A single stylesheet was used for all styling.
- Flexbox was the primary layout tool throughout the project.
- No focus on responsive/mobile design for this stage.
